# Coding Resources

I'm creating this resource mostly for myself to combine all my learning resources I used for coding in one place. But I think this also could be useful for other people who want to learn coding. Feel free to let me know if I should add other resources. 

‚ùå(DISCLAIMER: I'm not the owner of any of these resources. All the rights of the linked resources go to the respective owners.)

Also note that this will always be work in progress... so don't expect any completed parts here.

## General Resources

### Roadmap.sh
[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) provides role based and skill based roadmaps for developers. Found that pretty useful for my Front-End learning path but is also very useful for other learning paths.

## Frontend

### Web Development
I learned some HTML, CSS and Javascript in school but [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is the resource that leveled up my web development skills. They provide a really easy introduction to web development and I still use this website if I need some help regarding HTML or CSS.
But the point where everything was easier is when I switched out Javascript for Typescript in my Skillset. For Typescript I just used their own  to learn that.

### Frameworks
react, nextjs coming soon

## Backend

## Other languages

### C
C was the first ever language I learned many years ago. I actually just googled of a book about it back then. So I found the [C HowTo](https://www.c-howto.de/c-programmieren-lernen/) book. It provided a good foundation for my carrer as a developer. It's in german, so I don't know if it's useful for you. But for german speaking people I can recommend it.

Python, C++, Java coming soon

## Workflows

## Git

### Gitflow
Learned and used [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) in my first internship. Never used any other way of working with git. I found it very easy to work with Gitflow.


## Clean Code etc.


### When is a function too long?
A while ago I tended to write functions that were way to long. So a colleague send me [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/475675/when-is-a-function-too-long) Stackoverflow topic which helped me alot.
