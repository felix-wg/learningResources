# Coding Resources

I'm creating this resource mostly for myself to combine all my learning resources for coding in one place. But I think this also could be useful for other people who want to learn coding. Feel free to let me know if I should add other resources.

Raodmap.sh provides role based and skill based roadmaps for developers. Found that pretty useful for my Front-End learning path but is also very useful for other learning paths.

## Clean Code etc.
