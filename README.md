# Learning material for coding

I'm creating this resource mostly for myself to combine all my learning resources I used for coding in one place. But I think this also could be useful for other people who want to learn coding. Feel free to let me know if I should add other resources.

## General Resources

### Roadmap.sh
[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) provides role based and skill based roadmaps for developers. Found that pretty useful for my Front-End learning path but is also very useful for other learning paths.

## Frontend

### Web Development
I learned some HTML, CSS and Javascript in school but [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is the resource that leveled up my web development skills. They provide a really easy introduction to web development and I still use this website if I need some help regarding HTML or CSS.
But the point where everything was easier is when I switched out Javascript for Typescript in my Skillset. For Typescript I just used their own [Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to learn that.

### Frameworks

## Backend

## Workflows

### Gitflow
Learned and used [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) in my first internship. Never used any other way of working with git. I found it very easy to work with Gitflow.


## Clean Code etc.

### When is a function too long?
A while ago I tended to write functions that were way to long. So a colleague send me [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/475675/when-is-a-function-too-long) Stackoverflow topic which helped me alot.
