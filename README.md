# Learning material for coding

I'm creating this resource mostly for myself to combine all my learning resources I used for coding in one place. But I think this also could be useful for other people who want to learn coding. Feel free to let me know if I should add other resources.

## General Resources

### [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)
Raodmap.sh provides role based and skill based roadmaps for developers. Found that pretty useful for my Front-End learning path but is also very useful for other learning paths.

## Frontend

## Backend

## Workflows

### [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
Learned and used Gitflow in my first internship. Never used any other way of working with git. I found it very easy to work with Gitflow.



## Clean Code etc.

### When is a function too long?
A while ago I tended to write functions that were way to long. So a colleague send me [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/475675/when-is-a-function-too-long) Stackoverflow topic which helped me alot.
